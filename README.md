# STM32 Breakout-Board using STM32F103C8T6 Microcontroller

Using this medium-density microcontroller, an experimental peripheral board was designed using KiCAD to validate PCB design principles that I have learnt. It has formed a template for future layouts and schematic designs. For further information on my design choices, method and components selected and their placement, please read the design-considerations PDF in the repository.

# BOSCH BMP180 Drivers

The following device drivers were developed to be used with the respective breakout board designed, to test the I2C interface. All instructions and files can be found in the folder
added.
